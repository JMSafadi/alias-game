### Setting Up Environment Variables  

1. **Copy the Example File:**  

To create your own environment configuration, start by copying the example `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.

2. **Edit the '.env' file:**  

Open the newly created `.env` file in a text editor and replace the placeholder values with your actual MongoDB credentials.

3. **Run the Application:**  

Once you have set your environment variables, you can start the application with Docker.

## Note  

Make sure to keep your `.env` file private and not share it in version control. The `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore`  to prevent it from being tracked by Git.
